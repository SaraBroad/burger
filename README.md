# burger

The Burger app allows users to enter a burger into a field, add it to a list of burgers, and mark it as devoured. This app utilizes an MVC file structure with a MySQL database to store and access information.

First, I organized create a file structure based on the MVC approached, created my schemas to enter into the database, and established the database on MySQL. I installed the "npm" packages to establish a server connection through express and to be able to utilize Handlebars as a template engine. I used CSS and Bootstrap to create an appealing layout that is easy for people to use. I used an object-relational mapping method to set-up the functions to interact with the model to pull, input, and modify data into the database.
